# Single Responsibility

As the name suggests, this principle states that each class should have one responsibility, one single purpose. This means that a class will do only one job, which leads us to conclude it should have only one reason to change.


Не нужно все помещать в один монстр-класс, который умеет все – лучше разделить его на несколько.


When writing a class according to the SRP principle, we have to think about the problem domain, business needs, and application architecture. It is very subjective, which makes implementing this principle harder then it seems. It will not be as simple as the example we have in this tutorial.
